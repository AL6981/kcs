        <p>My name is Keith Maschinot and I have been in the custom upholstery business for 41 years. In the early years, you could find me building interiors for street rods, vans, and classic car restorations.  In my spare time, I was building and riding custom motorcycles, and it was then I discovered there was a need for quality custom seats. I knew I could design and build a better product than was commercially available, so I did. This side gig soon developed into a full time custom motorcycle seat building business; Keith’s Custom Leather Seats.

During the past 32 years, I have designed and built custom seats for some of the premier bike builders in the country. Many of these bikes have been featured in popular bike magazines such as Easy Riders, VQ, V-Twin, Barnett's, Hot Bike, Iron Works, American Iron, Big Twin and Hot Rod Bikes. My seats are in use on motorcycles owned by famous, infamous and not so famous people, and they all have one thing in common - they know that a quality custom seat is the finishing touch on any custom bike.

All of my seats are hand crafted from premium leather but are also available in exotic skins, such as alligator, elephant, ostrich, shark, etc. From the seat pan to finished product, every seat is made to the customer’s individual specifications and taste. I handle the entire fabrication process; your project gets the personal attention it deserves. Your custom seat will be born from your imagination, transformed by me into steel, foam and leather, and will finally evolve into a unique, personal work of art.

 I’m in business for one main reason, to make the finest custom motorcycle seats available. My seats will truly add the finishing touch to your bike. It’s where your butt meets the seat that you become one with the bike.

Best Regards,

Keith Maschinot</p>
