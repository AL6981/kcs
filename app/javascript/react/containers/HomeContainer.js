        <p>My custom leather motorcycle seats are what real biker art looks like.  Many of the seats shown here were on the bikes built  by the legendary Louis Falcigno from C&L Hog Shop, and have been featured in EasyRiders Magazine. There are many craftsmen in the industry creating what they call “old school” chopper seats and will sell you on their old-world style and techniques. Ask them if they were doing it 30 years ago, and then give me a call instead.</p>
